Implementation Plan
1. Technology Stack
Programming Language: TypeScript with Node.js for asynchronous operations and efficient API handling.

Libraries and SDKs:  
xchain-mayachain-amm: For simulating and estimating swaps on Maya Protocol.

Uniswap V3 SDK: For simulating swaps and estimating price impact on Uniswap.

Axios or similar: For making API calls to Midgard and The Graph.

Vultisig SDK: For wallet integration and transaction management.

Environment:  
Development: Local environment with testing on Maya Protocol’s stagenet and Arbitrum testnet.

Production: Low-latency server close to relevant networks.

2. Development Phases
The development process is divided into the following phases:
Phase 1: Setup and Integration
Set up the TypeScript/Node.js project structure.

Integrate the Vultisig SDK for wallet operations, ensuring support for Maya Protocol transactions with memos.

Implement API clients for:
Maya Protocol’s Midgard API (https://midgard.mayachain.info/v2).

Uniswap V3 subgraph on Arbitrum (https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/FQ6JYszEKApsBpAmiHesRsd9Ygc6mzmpNRANeVQFYoVX?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one).

Phase 2: Data Fetching and Calculation
Fetch pool data from Maya Protocol for specified assets (e.g., ARB, USDC).

Fetch corresponding pool data from Uniswap on Arbitrum.

Calculate the price of each asset on both platforms and determine the price difference.

Check the trading status on both platforms to ensure trading is active.

Phase 3: Trade Simulation
Use xchain-mayachain-amm to simulate swaps on Maya Protocol, estimating output amounts and fees.

Use the Uniswap V3 SDK to simulate swaps on Uniswap, estimating output, price impact, and gas costs.

Calculate the net profitability of the arbitrage trade, accounting for all fees and slippage.

Phase 4: Trade Execution
If the simulated trade is profitable, execute the trade using Vultisig.

Handle transaction signing and broadcasting for both Maya Protocol and Uniswap swaps.

Implement retry logic for failed transactions due to network issues or slippage.

Phase 5: Logging and Monitoring
Implement comprehensive logging for all bot activities, including price checks, simulations, and transactions.

Set up monitoring tools to track bot performance, errors, and profitability.

Ensure logs are stored securely for auditing purposes.

3. Testing Plan
Unit Testing:  
Test individual components such as price calculation, trade simulation, and transaction signing.

Integration Testing:  
Test end-to-end functionality, ensuring data flows correctly between APIs, simulations, and executions.

Test Environments:  
Use Maya Protocol’s stagenet for testing Maya swaps.

Use Arbitrum’s testnet for testing Uniswap interactions.

Scenario Testing:  
Simulate various market conditions (e.g., high volatility, low liquidity) to ensure bot reliability.

Test edge cases such as halted trading, high slippage, and API failures.

4. Deployment Plan
Server Setup:  
Deploy the bot on a low-latency server optimized for proximity to Maya Protocol and Arbitrum nodes.

Security Measures:  
Securely manage private keys or wallet access using environment variables or hardware wallets.

Implement access controls and encryption for sensitive data.

Monitoring and Alerts:  
Set up real-time alerts for critical errors, failed transactions, or significant profitability events.

Regularly review logs and performance metrics to optimize bot efficiency.

5. Risk Management
Market Risks: Monitor for sudden price movements that could turn profitable trades into losses.

Operational Risks: Implement redundancy for API calls and transaction retries to handle network failures.

Security Risks: Regularly audit wallet access and transaction signing processes to prevent unauthorized access.
